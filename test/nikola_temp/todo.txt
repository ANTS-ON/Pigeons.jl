simplify user interface so that people don't need to create the stan model 

currently the var reference for stan seems to be putting the gaussian on the constrained space?
-- try to put it on the unconstrained space and then constrain your vector afterwards

problem: number of constrained + unconstrained params might not be equal
-- what happens in that case as you apply the transformation in-place to the vector?
-- possible solution: pad one of the vectors with nans?
